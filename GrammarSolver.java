//CS211 Chapter12_Project03
//This class randomly generates sentences given BNF grammar file
//Reference: Blake Denniston -his code gave reference to my generatePhrase method.
//FUN FACT: his code didn't work.
//However, I really liked the structure of his code as it was easier to follow than mine and so, I fixed it up.
//Nonetheless, I feel like I indirectly worked with Mr.Blakey and want to give him credit.
